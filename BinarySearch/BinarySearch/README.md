# Binary Search
//Short summary or background information

## Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.
Without utilizing any built in methods, return the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key. 
Or return -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
I went for a time saving approach of O(log n). 
As I am not instatiating the array that is given, it seemed to make sense to focus on the most time efficient approach.


## Solution
This whiteboard solution does not accurately solve a binary search.
